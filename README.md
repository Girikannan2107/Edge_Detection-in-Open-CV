🔍 Edge Detection Using Python & OpenCV

This project demonstrates edge detection techniques in digital image processing using Python and OpenCV. Edge detection is a fundamental concept in computer vision that helps in identifying object boundaries and extracting important structural information from images.

The program processes input images by converting them to grayscale, reducing noise using Gaussian blur, and applying the Canny Edge Detection algorithm to highlight edges clearly.
